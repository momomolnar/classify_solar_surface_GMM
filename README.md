Classify the solar surface in distinct types based on unsupervised
learning algorithms. We use Variational Gaussian Mixture Model 
algorithms with Dirichlet generative process to asses the number of 
distinct types of solar surface from high resolution solar observations
from the Dunn Solar Telescope, Hinode, SDO and GONG.
